# coal-mine-detection
coal mine detection using image patches with deep learning models
Coal mine image patches have been prepared with Sentinel-2 images
Two land use/landcover layers have been created as Coal and No Coal mines to classify the image patches.
The model includes, code for splitting the data into trainign and validation
VGG model with transfer learning and a classification code to try on a sentinel image patch
